# juTrack
juTrack searches for tracks from the logged in user in jira to simplify time bookings.
It uses the Jira REST interface to gather your actions done in a Jira system.

## Download
You can download juTrack directly from [Github](https://github.com/iBiber/juTrack/releases/latest).
There are two binaries you can download:
* The commandline client **"jutrack-cli.jar"**
* A graphical client **"jutrack-gui.jar"**

The grahical client uses a table to present the results and generate also a report like the command line client do.

## Settings
The settings and default values can be defined in an application.properties file. [Here it is described how to change these settings](application_properties).
